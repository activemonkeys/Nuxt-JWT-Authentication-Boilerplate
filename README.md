# Nuxt-JWT-Authentication-Boilerplate

### This is kinda specific to the project I'm working on. Feel free to customize it

### I was looking hard on how to implement JWT Authentication on Nuxt, but could not find anything to fit my needs. So I made this boilerplate. Feel free to ask any question

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
